# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
